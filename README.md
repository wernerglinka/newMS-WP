# A new Metalsmith starter

This is my personal Metalsmith sandbox site. I am periodically experimenting with new features. 

Features:
  - Uses Nunjucks for templating
  - Pages are build from Markdown and Wordpress
  - Page transitions and page prefetch with Swup
  - Page backgrounds with Gradient Magic CSS
  - Uses Feather icons
  - Images are progressive/responsive and lazy loaded
  - Images hosted on Cloudinary
